To start up the project locally, if you do not have a version, clone the files from the github repo in to a folder on you pc or mac.

Open the index.html (found in the root directory) on a browser (Chrome, Firefox or Safari).

This should open the page and you can begin!

note: this has been tested in Firefox, Safari and Chrome but not in IE or Edge.
