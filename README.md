# developme-technical-challange

To start up the project locally, if you do not have a version, pull all the files from the github repo in to a folder on you pc or mac.
Open the index.html (found in the root directory) on a browser (chrome, firefox etc).
This should open the page and you can begin!

note: this has been tested in firefox, safari and chrome but not in IE or Edge.
